# A Closer Look at Academic Papers

Conducting a research is similar to writing an academic paper. Every sections are essential and have their own purpose:

--

1. **The Introduction** introduce your research question (which can be your title too) and includes the variables that you will investigate.

--

2. **The Literature Review** indicates how the variables are related (model) and finishes with your hypotheses. The model includes all hypotheses that will be tested and only the tested hypotheses.

--

3. **The Method** presents 1/ the variables and 2/ the mathematical equation that summarises your model and which includes the test of all hypotheses.

--

4. **The Results** describes the numeric outputs of the tests for each hypothesis.

--

5. **The Discussion and Conclusion** are interpretations of these results. Strengths and weaknesses of the study are also presented.

# 1. Introduction: Declare your Variables

---

# Academic Papers' Introduction

An introduction is a section **presenting your variables and why you investigate them**.

There is little reference to previous academic research, just a description of actual facts.

It should end with your **Research Question**, a question that includes all the main variables investigated which wonders about a potential relationship between them.

--

For example:
- "What is the relationship between Job Satisfaction, Salary and Gender?"
- "How does sales experience influence the performance of sales managers and sales representatives?"

# What is a Variable?

A variable itself is a subtle concept, but basically it comes down to finding some way of assigning a *value* (numbers or characters) to **labels**.

--

In these examples, the **bold part is "label"** and the *italicised part is "the value of the variable"*:

- My **height** is *183 cm*
- This morning, I had a *large* **coffee**
- My **gender** is *male*

Each variable has a **Role** and a **Type**, it is essential to learn how to identify them.

## Type of Variables

---

# Type of Variables

Variables can have different types:

- **Categorical**: If the variable's possibilities are words or sentences (character string)

  - if the possibilities cannot be ordered: Categorical Nominal (*e.g.*, $gender$ male, female, other)
  
  - if the possibilities can be ordered: Categorical Ordinal (*e.g.*, $size$ S, M, L)
  
- **Continuous**: If the variable's possibilities are numbers (*e.g.*, $age$, $temperature$, ...) 

--

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` **Warning**: Variables can be converted to either Categorical and Continuous but it is always better to keep them in their correct scale.

```{r out.width='30%'}

## Status of Variables

---

# Status of Variables

Variables can either be:

- **Observed variables**: They are directly measured in your survey (e.g., gender, age, scale items)

or

- **Latent variables**: They are calculated from multiple observed variables (generally scale items) in order to approximate a theoretical construct.

--

Example of a scale to measure the **"Perceived Ease-of-use" of MS EXCEL** in 4 items were measured from 1 "totally disagree" to 7 "totally agree":

.pull-left[
- **q1.** I think learning MS EXCEL is easy
- **q2.** Understanding MS EXCEL is easy
- **q3.** I am good at using MS EXCEL
- **q4.** I think using MS EXCEL is easy
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph rmarkdown {
  graph [rankdir = RL]
  
  node [shape = oval]
  'Perceived Ease-of-use
  of MS EXCEL'
  
  node [shape = box]
  q1; q2; q3; q4
  
  'Perceived Ease-of-use
  of MS EXCEL'-> {q1 q2 q3 q4}   

}
", height = 200)
```
]

---

# Focus on Psychometric Scales

**A psychometric scale is a series of questions (items) used to measure a latent variable**

**A score has to be calculated** from all the items to produce the variable to analyse:

- Average of all items (equal contribution to the latent variable score)
- Factor analysis (unequal contribution to the latent variable score)

--

**A scale should have been validated** by its academic authors: 

- Don't change the items except when possible
- Don't change items' range of possibilities

--

To be analysed, **a scale has some requirements**:
- All the items must have the same range of possibilities/modalities
- All the items must be analysed in the same direction
- All the items must correlate together (scale reliability)
- A unique theoretical construct score has to be calculated from all the items

## Role of Variables

---

# Predictors, Outcomes and Controls

It's important to keep the two roles "variable doing the explaining" and "variable being explained" distinct.

Let's denote the:
 - **Outcome**: "variable to be explained" (also called $Y$, Dependent Variable, or DV)
 - **Predictor**: "variable doing the explaining" (also called $X$, Independent Variable, or IV)
 
--

Statistics is only about identifying relationship between Predictor and Outcome variables also called **effect**

> An effect between 2 variables means that the changes in the values of a predictor variable are related to changes in the values of an outcome variable.

--

The only difference for **control variables** is that they are not included in the model or in the hypotheses but they are in the equation.

They are used to remove an irrelevant explanation of the variable changes.

# 2. Literature Review: Formulate your Hypotheses

---

# Hypotheses in a Nutshell

**An hypothesis is:**
1. A prediction supported by theory/literature
2. An affirmation designed to precisely describe the relationship between variables

> *“Hypothesis statements contain two or more variables that are measurable or potentially measurable and that specify how the variables are related”* (Kerlinger, 1986)

--

**An hypothesis include:**

- One or more Predictor(s) / Independent Variable(s)
- One Outcome / Dependent Variable (DV)
- Direction of the outcome if the predictor increases

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` **Warning**: 

Hypothesis cannot test equality between groups or modalities, they can only test differences or effects

---

# Alternative *vs.* Null Hypotheses

Every hypothesis has to state a difference (between groups or according values) also called $H_a$ (for alternative hypothesis) or $H_1$

Every alternative hypothesis has a null hypothesis counterpart (no difference between groups or according values) also called $H_0$ (pronounce H naught or H zero)

--

$H_a$ is viewed as a “challenger” hypothesis to the null hypothesis $H_0$.
  
> **Statistics are used to test the probability of obtaining your results in the Null Hypothesis scenario. If this probability is low, then we reject the Null Hypothesis (and consider the Alternative Hypothesis as credible).**

---

# Main Effect Hypothesis

Is the **predicted relationship between one $Predictor$ and one $Outcome$ variable**

The $Outcome$ needs to be Continuous and the $Predictor$ can be either Continuous or Categorical (hypothesis formulation will change with its type)

---

# Main Effect Hypothesis Templates

In the following formulation templates, **replace the variables' name with yours** and *select the direction of the effect expected* ...

- #### Case 1: Predictor is Continuous 

.small[{**outcome**} {*increases/decreases/changes*} when {**predictor**} increases]

> .small[**Job satisfaction** *increases* when **salary** increases]

--

- #### Case 2: Predictor is Categorical (2 Categories)

.small[The {**outcome**} of {**predictor category 1**} is {*higher/lower/different*} than the {**outcome**} of {**predictor category 2**}]

> .small[The **Job satisfaction** of **EU employees** is *higher* than the **job satisfaction** of **Non-EU employees**]

--

- #### Case 3: Predictor is Categorical (3 or more Categories)

.small[The {**outcome**} of at least one of the {**predictor**} is {*higher/lower/different*} than the {**outcome**} of the other {**predictor**}]

> .small[The **Job satisfaction** of at least one of the **company's departments** is *higher* than the **Job satisfaction** of the other **company's departments**]

---

# Main Effect Hypothesis Examples

Main Effect Hypothesis: 

- $H_a$: **Driving errors** of **motorists who do not talk on the phone while driving** will be *lower* than **driving errors** of **motorists who talk on the phone while driving**

---

# Interaction Effect Hypothesis

**It predicts the influence of a second predictor on the relationship between a first predictor and an outcome variable**

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` **Warning**:

- The second predictor is also called moderator.
- The main effect of each predictor must be hypothesised as well
- The role of first and second predictors can be inverted with the exact same statistical results

This effect can change according to the values of a second predictor

]

Here, the effect of **Salary** on **Job Satisfaction** is *higher* for **Irish employees** than it is for **French employees** because their line is steeper.

# Special Case: Mediation Hypothesis

Formulation structure:

.center[The effect of {**predictor 1**} on {**outcome**} is explained by the {**predictor 2**}]

Warning: A mediation effect involves 3 requirements:
1. Predictor 1 needs to have a main effect on the Outcome
2. Predictor 1 needs to have a main effect on the Predictor 2
3. The main effect of Predictor 1 on the Outcome needs to disappear when Predictor 2 is taken into account

> Example: 
- The effect of **employee's age** on **job satisfaction** is explained by their **salary**

> Here, the requirements are:
1. Employee's age needs to have a main effect on job satisfaction
2. Employee's age needs to have a main effect on their salary
3. The main effect of Employee's age on the job satisfaction needs to disappear when salary is taken into account

# Mediation Effect Hypothesis Example

Variables:
- Outcome = Happiness (continuous from 0 to 7)

# Model Representation

Models are an overview of the predicted relationship between variables stated in the hypotheses

You must follow these rules:
- Rule 1: All the arrows correspond to an hypothesis to be tested
- Rule 2: All the tested hypotheses have to be represented with an arrow
- Rule 3: Hypotheses using the same Outcome variable should be included in the same model
- Rule 4: Only one Outcome variable is included in each model (except for SEM model)

# Structure of Models

Distinguish square and circles
- **squares** are actual **measures/items**
- **circles** are **latent variables** related to measures/items

Example:
- $Salary$ is directly measured (in $, €, or £) so it's a square.
- $Job\,Satisfaction$ is a latent variable with several questions so it's a circle.

Items used for latent variables can be omitted in a model, variables are the most important.

We can distinguish 2 types of relationship in a model:
- Main effect relationship
- Interaction effect relationship

```
]

This model tests three hypotheses:
- 2 main effects
- 1 interaction effect

---

# Types of Model

## Simple Model

- One or more predictors
- Only one outcome
- Made of main or/and interaction effects

## Mediation Model (simple or moderated)

- At least 2 predictors (one call Mediator)
- Only one outcome
- Made of main effects only for simple mediation / main and interaction effects for moderated mediation

## Structural Equation Model (SEM)

- At least 2 predictors (usually latent variables)
- One or more outcome
- Made of main or/and interaction effects

---

# Simple Model

Simple Models are the most statistically powerful, easy to test and reliable models. Always prefer a simple model compared to a more complicated solution.

Warning, including interaction effect requires a significantly higher sample size.

Example:

```{r eval=TRUE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph {
    graph [rankdir = LR]
  
    node [shape = box]
    'Salary'; 'Gender'; 'Age'
    node [shape = circle]
    'Job Satisfaction'
    node [shape = point, width = 0, height = 0]
    ''
    
    'Age' -> 'Job Satisfaction'
    'Gender' -> ''
    'Salary' -> '' [arrowhead = none]
    '' -> 'Job Satisfaction'
    
    subgraph {
      rank = same; 'Gender'; '';
    }
    subgraph {
      rank = same; 'Age'; 'Salary';
    }
  }", height = 200, width = 800)
```

This model tests four hypotheses:
- 3 main effects
- 1 interaction effect

---

# Mediation Models

A Mediation model is a complex path analysis between 3 variables, where one of them explains the relationship between the other two. It is usually used to identify cognitive process in psychology.

Example:

```{r eval=TRUE, fig.align="left"}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph {
    graph [rankdir = LR]
  
    node [shape = box]
    'Exam Results'
    node [shape = oval]
    'Self-Esteem'; Happiness
    
    'Exam Results' -> {Happiness 'Self-Esteem'}
    'Self-Esteem' -> Happiness

  }", height = 200, width = 800)
```

This model tests one hypothesis:
- 1 mediation effect
- but it requires 2 main effects

---

# Structural Equation Model

A Structural Equation Model (SEM) is a complex path analysis between multiple variables including multiple Outcomes and using factor analysis for latent variable estimation.

```{r eval=TRUE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph rmarkdown {
  graph [rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = oval]
  'Perceived Ease-of-use'; 'Perceived Usefulness'; 'Intention to Use'
  
  node [shape = box]
  PU1; PU2; PU3; PU4; PU5; PEOU1; PEOU2; PEOU3; PEOU4; BI1; BI2; 'Actual Use'
  
  {PU1 PU2 PU3 PU4 PU5} -> 'Perceived Usefulness' [arrowhead = none]
  {PEOU1 PEOU2 PEOU3 PEOU4} -> 'Perceived Ease-of-use' [arrowhead = none]
  {BI1 BI2} -> 'Intention to Use' [arrowhead = none]
  
  'Perceived Usefulness' -> 'Intention to Use'
  'Perceived Ease-of-use' -> {'Perceived Usefulness' 'Intention to Use'}
  'Intention to Use' -> 'Actual Use'
  
  subgraph {
      rank = same; 'Perceived Usefulness'; 'Perceived Ease-of-use';
  }
  
  subgraph {
      rank = same; PU1; PU2; PU3; PU4; PU5; PEOU1; PEOU2; PEOU3; PEOU4; BI1; BI2;
  }

}
", height = 300, width = 800)
```

This model tests four hypotheses:
- 4 main effects
- because the relationship between items of a scale and their corresponding latent variable is considered as significant by default if the scale is valid

---

# A Good Model

- Comprehensiveness: Explains a wide range of phenomena
- Internal Consistency: Propositions and assumptions are consistent and fit together in a coherent manner
- Parsimony: Contains only those concepts and assumptions essential for the explanation of a phenomenon
- Testability: Concepts and relational statements are precise.
- Empirical Validity: Holds up when tested in the real world.

Example: 

```{r eval=TRUE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph rmarkdown {
  graph [rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = oval]
  'Perceived Ease-of-use'; 'Perceived Usefulness'; 'Intention to Use'
  
  node [shape = box]
  'Actual Use'
  
  'Perceived Usefulness' -> 'Intention to Use'
  'Perceived Ease-of-use' -> {'Perceived Usefulness' 'Intention to Use'}
  'Intention to Use' -> 'Actual Use'
  
  subgraph {
      rank = same; 'Perceived Usefulness'; 'Perceived Ease-of-use';
  }
}
", height = 300, width = 800)
```

## Equation

# A Basic Equation

```{r}
df <- 
  data.frame(
    Observation = letters[1:11],
    Outcome = 10:0, 
    Predictor = 10:0
  ) 
```

Let's imagine the perfect scenario: **your predictor Predictor variable explains perfectly the outcome variable**.

The corresponding equation is: $Outcome = Predictor$

.pull-left[
```{r}
df |> 
  kable(align = "ccc") |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 14)

# A Basic Equation

In the equation $Outcome = Predictor$, **three coefficients are hidden** because they are unused:
- the **intercept coefficient** $b_{0}$ (i.e., the value of the Outcome when the Predictor = 0) which is 0 in our case
- the **estimate coefficient** $b_{1}$  (i.e., how much the Outcome increases when the Predictor increases by 1) which is 1 in our case
- the **error coefficient** $e$ (i.e., how far from the prediction line the values of the Outcome are) which is 0 in our case

So in general, the relation between a predictor and an outcome can be written as:
$$Outcome = b_{0} + b_{1}\,Predictor + e$$

which is in our case:

$$Outcome = 0 + 1 * Predictor + 0$$

---

# A Basic Equation

The equation $Outcome = b_{0} + b_{1}\,Predictor + e$ is the same as the good old $y = ax + b$ (here ordered as $y = b + ax$) where $b_{0}$ is $b$ and $b_{1}$ is $a$.

It is very important to know that under **EVERY** statistical test, a similar equation is used (t-test, ANOVA, Chi-square are all linear regressions).

```{r fig.width=5.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.align='center'}
plot0 <- data.frame(Predictor = 0:10, Outcome = 0:10) |>
  ggplot(aes(Predictor, Outcome)) +

# Relationship between Variables

Relationship between a $Predictor$ and an $Outcome$ variable (stated in a main effect hypothesis or in an interaction effect hypothesis) is analysed in terms of:

.center[**"How many units of the Outcome variable increases/decreases/changes when the Predictor increases by 1 unit?"**]

For example:
> How much Job Satisfaction increases when the Salary increases by €1?

The value of how much of the Outcome variable changes:
- Is called the **Estimate** (also called Unstandardised Estimate)
- Uses the letter $b$ in equations (e.g., $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$, ...)

For example:
> If Job Satisfaction increases by 0.1 on a scale from 0 to 5 when the Salary increases by €1, then *b* associated to Salary is 0.1

---

# Significance of Relationships

To evaluate if the strength of the relationship $b$ between a Predictor and an Outcome variable is significant, an equation is statistically tested using all the predictors related to the same Outcome.

The basic equation of a statistical model is:

$$Outcome = b_0 + b_n \,Predictors + Error$$

where the $Predictors$ includes all the $n$ variables used as predictor in formulated hypotheses using this specific $Outcome$ variable and being associated to a specific $b$ estimate.

This expresses the idea that:
- The Outcome can be described by one or multiple predictors.
- The remaining part of the Outcome's variability that is not explained by the predictors is call the Error.

---

# Equations, Variables and Effect Types

Except in special cases:
- An Outcome (or Dependent Variable) has to be Continuous
- A Predictor can be Continuous or Categorical 

Example: $Job\,Satisfaction = b_{0} + b_{1}\,Salary + b_{2}\,Origin + e$

In this equation:
- $Salary$ is continuous with a main effect on $Job\,Satisfaction$ ( $b_{1}$)
- $Origin$ is categorical with a main effect on $Job\,Satisfaction$ ( $b_{2}$)

---

# Equations, Variables and Effect Types

An interaction effect is represented by multiplying the 2 predictors involved:

$$Job\,Satisfaction = b_{0} + b_{1}\,Salary + b_{2}\,Origin + b_{3}\,Salary*Origin + e$$

In this equation:
- $Salary$ is continuous with a main effect on $Job\,Satisfaction$ ( $b_{1}$)
- $Origin$ is categorical with a main effect on $Job\,Satisfaction$ ( $b_{2}$)
- $Salary$ and $Origin$ have an interaction effect on $Job\,Satisfaction$ ( $b_{3}$)

# Calculation of Latent Variables' Score

Here are the results with 3 students. The score of the "Perceived Ease-of-use of MS EXCEL" latent variable is calculated using the average of all items.

```{r}
tribble(
  ~employee, ~q1, ~q2, ~q3, ~q4,
  "Sinead",   7,  5,   7,   7,
  "Patrick",   5,  4,   6,   6, 
  "Damien",   3,  1,   2,   3
) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(peo_score = mean(c(q1, q2, q3, q4))) %>% 
  kable()
```

---

# Validity and Reliability

**Validity = is my variable measuring the construct that I think I am measuring?**
- Does the measurement make sense? 
- Would the results be reproduced with another scale measuring the same latent variable?
- Are the results correlated to latent variables that are related?

Validity test is only performed when a scale is created (no need for existing scales)

**Reliability = consistency of items inside a measurement**
- Test-retest reliability
- Inter-rater reliability
- Correlation inter-item (Cronbach's alpha)

Reliability test is performed every time a scale is used but only using Cronbach's alpha

---

# Validity and Reliability

include_graphics("https://www.publichealthnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/560px-Reliability_and_validity.svg_.png")
```

# Latent Variable

In order to measure the theoretical constructs/concepts of your model, you will have to select the best measurement scale made of multiple items.

Reliability assessment is performed every time a scale is used (Cronbach's alpha)

Cronbach's alpha indicates the overall correlation between items

Cronbach's alpha ranges from -1 to 1:

- If its value is higher than 0.7, then the scale is reliable to measure the latent variable 
- If its value is lower than 0.7, then proceed with caution or remove/modify the scale to obtain a value higher than 0.7

# Manually Recode Variable

.pull-left[
Some scales include negative formulation of some items to check that participants are reading the questions.

For example in a Job Satisfaction scale:
- It. 1: I love my job
- It. 2: I like going to work everyday
- It. 3: I hate what I'm doing at work

If I answer high to the 2 first items, my answer to the 3rd item should be low.

The values of an item from 0 to 10 has to be reversed:
- 0 becomes 10
- 1 becomes 9
- ...
- 10 becomes 0

The use of correlation tables is widespread in the literature, and they are a great tool for descriptive analysis but **do not test your hypotheses with correlation matrices**. A good practice is to remove all $p$-values or $p$-stars from them.

$p$-values should only be produced to test an hypothesis that has been already formulated, any other is use is called $p$**-hacking**.

## Hypothesis Testing

---

# Good Practices with Hypothesis Testing

- All hypotheses using the **same Outcome variable have to be tested in the same model** and not separately.

- Even if available, no need to use t-tests or ANOVA separate modules because the **Linear Regression can test all types of hypothesis**.

- **Do not use a correlation matrix to test your hypotheses**, they are exculively dedicated to evaluate correlations between predictors.

- A $p$-value never equals $0$, **round to $p < .001$ if lower than $0.001$**.

- Despite never shown in academic papers, the **4 conditions of applications for Linear Model should always be checked**:
  - Linearity of the relationship,
  - Normal distribution of the residuals,
  - Homogeneity of the residuals,
  - Independence of observations.

## Hypotheses with Continuous Predictors and with Categorical Predictors Having 2 Categories

---

# Hypothesis Testing

1. Open your file
2. Check the type of your variables
3. **Analyses** > **Regression** > **Linear Regression**
4. Set the Outcome as DV and 
  - **To test the main effect hypotheses**: set the Predictors as Covariates/Factors
  - **To test interaction effect hypotheses**: In Model Builder, select all predictor with `CTRL` (win) or `Command` (mac) and bring them as interaction in the model
  
--
  
Communicate the Results about the full model and each hypothesis:

--

- Use **Model Fit Measure Table** to evaluate the accuracy of the full model

The predictions from a model including all effects are significant/not-significant better than without these effects $(R^2 = value_{R^2}$, $F(df1,df2) = value_{F}$, $p = value_{p})$

--

- Use **Model Coefficients Table** to conclude about each hypothesis

The effect of $Predictor$ on $Outcome$ is statistically significant/not-significant, therefore $H_0$ can be rejected/accepted $(b = value_{estimate}, 95\% CI [lower\,CI, upper\,CI]$, $t(df2) = value_t$, $p = value_{p})$.

## Hypotheses with Categorical Predictors Having 3 or more Categories

---

# Hypothesis Testing

1. Open your file
2. Check the type of your variables
3. **Analyses** > **Regression** > **Linear Regression**
4. Set the Outcome as DV and 
  - **To test the main effect hypotheses**: set the Predictors as Factors
  - **To test interaction effect hypotheses**: In Model Builder options, select all predictor with `CTRL` (win) or `Command` (mac) and bring them as interaction in the model
5. Tick **ANOVA Test** in Model Coefficient options
  
--
  
Communicate the Results about the full model and each hypothesis:

--

- Use **Model Fit Measure Table** to evaluate the accuracy of the full model

The predictions from a model including all effects are significant/not-significant better than without these effects $(R^2 = value_{R^2}$, $F(df1,df2) = value_{F}$, $p = value_{p})$

- Use **Omnibus ANOVA Test Table** to conclude about each hypothesis

The effect of $Predictor$ on $Outcome$ is statistically significant/not-significant, therefore $H_0$ can be rejected/accepted $(F(df_{predictor}, df_{residual}) = value_F$, $p = value_{p})$.
