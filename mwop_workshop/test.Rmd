# A Closer Look at Academic Papers

Conducting a research is similar to writing an academic paper. Every sections are essential and have their own purpose:

--

1. **The Introduction** introduce your research question (which can be your title too) and includes the variables that you will investigate.

--

2. **The Literature Review** indicates how the variables are related (model) and finishes with your hypotheses. The model includes all hypotheses that will be tested and only the tested hypotheses.

--

3. **The Method** presents 1/ the variables and 2/ the mathematical equation that summarises your model and which includes the test of all hypotheses.

--

4. **The Results** describes the numeric outputs of the tests for each hypothesis.

--

5. **The Discussion and Conclusion** are interpretations of these results. Strengths and weaknesses of the study are also presented.

# 1. Introduction: Declare your Variables

# Academic Papers' Introduction

An introduction is a section **presenting your variables and why you investigate them**.

There is little reference to previous academic research, just a description of actual facts.

It should end with your **Research Question**, a question that includes all the main variables investigated which wonders about a potential relationship between them.

--

For example:
- "What is the relationship between Job Satisfaction, Salary and Gender?"
- "How does sales experience influence the performance of sales managers and sales representatives?"

# What is a Variable?

A variable itself is a subtle concept, but basically it comes down to finding some way of assigning a *value* (numbers or characters) to **labels**.

--

In these examples, the **bold part is "label"** and the *italicised part is "the value of the variable"*:

- My **height** is *183 cm*
- This morning, I had a *large* **coffee**
- My **gender** is *male*

Each variable has a **Role** and a **Type**, it is essential to learn how to identify them.

## Type of Variables

# Type of Variables

Variables can have different types:

- **Categorical**: If the variable's possibilities are words or sentences (character string)

  - if the possibilities cannot be ordered: Categorical Nominal (*e.g.*, $gender$ male, female, other)
  
  - if the possibilities can be ordered: Categorical Ordinal (*e.g.*, $size$ S, M, L)
  
- **Continuous**: If the variable's possibilities are numbers (*e.g.*, $age$, $temperature$, ...) 

--

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` **Warning**: Variables can be converted to either Categorical and Continuous but it is always better to keep them in their correct scale.
