# Requirements for Statistical Analyses

Before starting statistical analyses, you have to:

--

- **Identify your variables**, their type (Categorical vs. Continuous), their role (Predictor vs. Ouctome), and their status (Observed vs. Latent)

--

- Properly **formulate your hypotheses** (e.g., each hypothesis include one continuous outcome and one or more predictors as well as how the outcome changes when the predictor increases)

--

- Accurately **draw your model** (e.g., each variable in a box, each arrow between boxes is an hypothesis that you will test)

--

- **Specify the equation corresponding to your model**. Every single piece of results obtained in the statistical tables are referring to this equation.

# JAMOVI: Stats. Open. Now.

Jamovi is a statistical spreadsheet software designed to be **easy to use**. Jamovi is a compelling alternative to costly statistical products such as SPSS, SAS and JMP to cite a few.

Jamovi will always be **free and open** because Jamovi is made by the scientific community, for the scientific community.

- It can be **downloaded from its website** https://www.jamovi.org/
- It can also be **used without installation**, in a web browser, https://cloud.jamovi.org/ for **online demo** but this demo undergoes periods of downtime, and may cease functioning (without warning) at any time.

## Data Preparation

---

# Data Preparation

To test hypotheses involving latent variables measured from surveys, data for **each items have to be numeric** (e.g., from 1 to 7 or from 1 to 9).

Sometimes is automatically done by the survey platform, **if not you have to convert** participants' answers to numbers.

- In EXCEL, `Replace All` can be efficient but also dangerous.

> Example, replacing "Agree" with "4" will change all "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly 4".

- In JAMOVI, a transformation rule can be applied item by item (see next slide).

## Scale Reliability

---

# Validity and Reliability

**Validity = is my variable measuring the construct that I think I am measuring?**
- Does the measurement make sense? 
- Would the results be reproduced with another scale measuring the same latent variable?
- Are the results correlated to latent variables that are related?

Validity test is only performed when a scale is created (no need for existing scales)

**Reliability = consistency of items inside a measurement**
- Test-retest reliability
- Inter-rater reliability
- Correlation inter-item (Cronbach's alpha)

Reliability test is performed every time a scale is used but only using Cronbach's alpha

---

# Validity and Reliability

```

---

# Latent Variable

In order to create a score for each theoretical constructs/concepts of your survey, **you need to make sure that your scale is reliable**.

Reliability assessment is performed every time a scale is used by **calculating its Cronbach's alpha**.

Cronbach's alpha indicates the **overall correlation between items** (inter-item correlation).

Cronbach's alpha has a maximum of 1:

- If its value is **higher than 0.7**, then the scale is reliable to measure the latent variable 
- If its value is **lower than 0.7**, then proceed with caution or remove/modify the scale to obtain a value higher than 0.7

**Latent variables are calculated only if the scale reliability (Cronbach's alpha) is satisfactory.**

---

# Cronbach's alpha in JAMOVI

In the `Analysis` Tab:
1. Click `Factor` icon
2. Select `Reliability Analysis`
3. Bring all the items for the same theoretical construct in the `Items` box

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_1.png")
```

In our example, alpha = -2.91: **This too low and something is wrong**

---

# Cronbach's alpha in JAMOVI - Solution 1

Have a look at the Cronbach's alpha **if an item is dropped**:

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_4.png")
```

---

# Cronbach's alpha in JAMOVI - Solution 2

.pull-left[
Some scales include **negative formulation** of some items to check that participants are reading the questions.

For example, in a Job Satisfaction scale:
- $q1$: I love my job
- $q2$: I like going to work everyday
- $q3$: I hate what I'm doing at work

If I answer high to the 2 first items, my answer to the 3rd item should be low. 

However, to calculate a Latent Variable score **all items should have the same formulation** (all positive formulation or all negative formulation). 

Here, **the answers of the 3rd item have to be reversed**. 

]

--

.pull-right[
For an item ranging from 0 to 10, reversing this item will apply the following transformation:
- 0 becomes 10
- 1 becomes 9
- ...
- 10 becomes 0

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_5.png")
```
]

---

# Cronbach's alpha in JAMOVI - Solution 2

To identify which items have to be reversed, **have a look at the correlation heatmap**:
- If one item is negatively correlated with the others (values < 0 and red colour), this item has a different formulation
- Add the negatively correlated item to `Reverse Scaled Item` to observe the changes

Heatmap **before** reversing negatively correlated items:

```{r out.width='70%'}

## Latent Variable Score

---

# Compute Latent Variable Score

When Cronbach's alpha is satisfying enough, then calculate the **latent variable score by averaging the items** kept and reversed (don't include original items if they have been reversed)

```{r out.width='50%'}
include_graphics("https://www.memecreator.org/static/images/memes/3335270.jpg")
```

---

# Compute Latent Variable Score

In our example, here are the results with 3 employees:
- The item $q3$, negatively formulated, has been reversed in $q3_r$
- The score of the "Job Satisfaction" latent variable is calculated using the average of $q1$, $q2$ and $q3_r$ items.

```{r}
tribble(
  ~employee, ~q1, ~q2, ~q3, ~q3_r,
   "Sinead",   7,   5,   2,     8,
  "Patrick",   5,   4,   6,     4,
   "Damien",   3,  1,    7,     3
) |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(job_satisfaction_score = mean(c(q1, q2, q3_r))) |> 
  kable(
    col.names = c("employee", "$q1$", "$q2$", "$q3$", "$q3_r$", "job_satisfaction_score"),
    escape = TRUE
  )
```

In JAMOVI, there are two ways to calculate the average value of items:

1. Automatically within `Reliability Analysis` 
2. Manually by reversing all the items that need to be reversed and by creating an average variable

---

# Automatic Calculation

To automatically calculate the average of all items (including reversed items) and creating the latent variable score:

- After obtaining a satisfying Cronbach's alpha, unfold the `Save` options on the left menu.
- Tick `Mean score` (a new column is created in your data)

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_save.png")
```

---

# Automatic Calculation

Rename the newly created column from the `Data` tab:

```{r out.width='60%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_save_2.png")
```

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` Warning: the calculation of the average includes the reversed items but the values of the reversed items themselves haven't been modified in the Data.

---

# Manual Calculation

First, manually reverse all items that need to be reversed by either:

.pull-left[
- Data > Transform: edit

```{r}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_6.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
- Data > Compute Variable
```
= (max scale + min scale) - variable
```

```{r}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_8.png")
```
]

Second, create a variable by calculating the average from the relevant items:

# Relationship between Variables

The relationship between a $Predictor$ or multiple $Predictors$ with an $Outcome$ variable is stated in a main effect hypothesis or in an interaction effect hypothesis.

The value of how much of the Outcome variable changes:
- Is called the **Estimate** (also called Unstandardised Estimate)
- Uses the letter $b$ in equations (e.g., $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$, ...)

We can distinguish two types of effect hypothesis:

- Main Effect Hypothesis:

> The relationship between 1 predictor and 1 outcome.

- Interaction Effect Hypothesis:

> The relationship between 2 or more predictors and 1 outcome. An interaction means that **the effect of a Predictor 1 on the Outcome variable will be different according the possibilities of a Predictor 2** (also called Moderation).

---

  }", height = 200, width = 400)
```
]

This model tests three hypotheses:
- 2 main effects
- 1 interaction effect

---

# The General Linear Model

A General Linear Model is used **to test all the hypotheses at once** and to calculate the predictors' estimate (relationship strength with the outcome).

Example:

$$Outcome = b_{0} + b_{1}\,Predictor\,1 + b_{2}\,Predictor\,2+ b_{3}\,Predictor\,1*Predictor\,2 + e$$

The estimates $b_0, b_1, ..., b_n$ are calculated by a JAMOVI.

- $b_0$ is the intercept and has no interest for hypothesis testing
- $b_1, ..., b_n$ are predictors' effect estimate and each of them is used to test an hypothesis

The predictors' effect estimate $b_1, ..., b_n$ are **the value of the slope of the best line between each predictor** and the outcome. 

It indicates **how many units of the outcome variable increases/decreases/changes when the predictor increases by 1 unit**

---

# Analysis of the Estimate

- If $b_1, ..., b_n = 0$, then:
  - The regression line is horizontal (no slope)
  - When the Predictor increases by 1 unit, the Outcome variable does not change
  - **The null hypothesis is not rejected**

--

- If $b_1, ..., b_n > 0$, then:
  - The regression line is positive (slope up)
  - When the Predictor increases by 1 unit, the Outcome variable increases by $b$
  - **The null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis considered as plausible**

--

- If $b_1, ..., b_n < 0$, then:
  - The regression line is negative (slope down)
  - When the Predictor increases by 1 unit, the Outcome variable decreases by $b$
  - **The null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis considered as plausible**
  
---

# Significance of Effect's Estimate

The statistical significance of an effect estimate depends on the **strength of the relationship** and on the **sample size**:

- An estimate of $b_1 = 0.02$ can be very small but still significantly different from $b_1 = 0$
- Whereas an estimate of $b_1 = 0.35$ can be stronger but in fact not significantly different from $b_1 = 0$

--

The significance is the probability to obtain your results with your sample in the null hypothesis scenario:

- Also called $p$-value
- Is between 0% and 100% which corresponds to a value between 0.0 and 1.0

**If the $p$-value is lower to 5% or 0.05, then the probability to obtain your results in the null hypothesis scenario is low enough to say that the null hypothesis scenario is rejected and there must be a link between the variables.**

--

Remember that the $p$-value is the probability of the data given the null hypothesis: $P(data|H_0)$.

## Hypotheses with Continuous Predictors and with Categorical Predictors Having 2 Categories

# Hypothesis Testing

1. Check the type of your variables
2. **Analyses** > **Regression** > **Linear Regression**
3. Set the Outcome as DV and 
  - **To test main effect hypotheses**: set the Predictors as Covariates/Factors
  - **To test interaction effect hypotheses**: In `Model Builder`, select all predictors with <kbd>CTRL</kbd> (win) or <kbd>command</kbd> (mac) and bring them as **interaction** in the model
  
--
  
Communicate the Results about the full model and each hypothesis:

- Use **Model Fit Measure Table** to evaluate the accuracy of the full model

> The predictions from a model including all effects are significantly/not-significantly better than without these effects $(R^2 = value_{R^2}$, $F(df1,df2) = value_{F}$, $p = value_{p})$

- Use **Model Coefficients Table** to conclude about each hypothesis

> The effect of $Predictor$ on $Outcome$ is statistically significant/not-significant, therefore $H_0$ can be rejected/accepted $(b = value_{estimate}, 95\% CI [lower\,CI, upper\,CI]$, $t(df2) = value_t$, $p = value_{p})$.

---

# Solution

```{r out.width='60%'}

The predictions from model including $salary$, $gender$ and their interaction on $job\,satisfaction$ are not-significantly better than without these effects $(R^2 = 0.227$, $F(3,14) = 1.368$, $p = 293)$.

---

# Solution

```{r out.width='60%'}
include_graphics("img/jamovi_regression_table.png")

The effect of $salary$ on $job\,satisfaction$ is not statistically significant, therefore $H_0$ cannot be rejected $(b = 0.000, 95\% CI [-0,000, 0.000]$, $t(14) = 0.659$, $p = 0.520)$.

The effect of $gender$ on $job\,satisfaction$ is not statistically significant, therefore $H_0$ cannot be rejected $(b = 2.138, 95\% CI [-0,241, 4.517]$, $t(14) = 1.927$, $p = 0.074)$.

The interaction effect between $salary$ and $gender$ on $job\,satisfaction$ is not statistically significant, therefore $H_0$ cannot be rejected $(b = -0.000, 95\% CI [-0,000, 0.000]$, $t(14) = -1.701$, $p = 0.111)$.

## Mediation Hypotheses

---

# Mediation Effect

Models with more than one outcome variables are a closer step toward causal models while not testing causality directly.

For example, a model which demonstrate that an existing relationship may be explained by a third variable, is more explanatory than a classic linear model.

This model is called Mediation

> Mediation is a hypothesized pseudo-causal model, whereby effect of a predictor to an outcome is transmitted through an intermediary variable M

It is a useful tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms of how variables are related to each other.

```{r}
grViz("
  digraph {
    graph [rankdir = LR]
    
    Predictor -> {Mediator Outcome}
    Mediator -> Outcome

  }", width = 800, height = 200)
```

---

# Mediation Effect

Let's take the example from [University of Virginia](https://data.library.virginia.edu/introduction-to-mediation-analysis/): $self-esteem$ mediates the effect of $grades$ on $happiness$

Data analysis is also presented in the [Jamovi Advanced Mediation Model website](https://jamovi-amm.github.io/glm_example1.html) and the data can be downloaded [here](https://jamovi-amm.github.io/glm_example1.html)

```{r}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph {
    graph [rankdir = LR]
  
    node []
    'self-esteem'; 'grades'; happiness
    
    'grades' -> {happiness 'self-esteem'}
    'self-esteem' -> happiness

  }", width = 800, height = 300)
```

---

# Mediation Effect

Imagine that previous studies have suggested that higher grades predict higher happiness. This is the **Total Effect**.

```{r out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("https://data.library.virginia.edu/files/mediation_ex1.png")
```

However, grades are not the real reason that happiness increases. Let's hypothesize that good grades boost oneâs self-esteem and then high self-esteem boosts oneâs happiness. This is the **Indirect Effect**.

```{r out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("https://data.library.virginia.edu/files/mediation_ex2.png")
```

Self-esteem is a mediator that explains the underlying mechanism of the relationship between grades and happiness.

# Mediation Analysis in Jamovi

In Jamovi, install the **jAMM module** by clicking on the cross "Modules" at top right corner > Jamovi library.

Then follow the example described here: https://jamovi-amm.github.io/glm_example1.html

```{r out.width='70%'}
include_graphics("https://jamovi-amm.github.io/glm/main.png")
```

# Mediation with jAMM in JAMOVI

```{r}
include_graphics("img/mediation_jamovi_jamm.gif")
```

# Mediation with jAMM in JAMOVI

In this example, the following mediation hypothesis is tested:

> The effect of **grades** on students' **happiness** is explained by their **self-esteem**

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://jamovi-amm.github.io/examples/virginia_simple/results1.png")
```

- The estimate $c$, **total effect**, is significantly different from 0 $(c = 0.3961, 95\% CI [0.180, 0.612], z = 3.6, p < .001)$
- The estimate $a$, between the predictor and the mediator, is significantly different from 0 $(a = 0.5610, 95\% CI [0.378, 0.744], z = 5.998, p < .001)$
- The estimate $c'$ has been reduced compared to the estimate $c$ $(c = 0.3961\,vs.\,c' = 0.0396)$
- The **indirect effect** $ab$ is significantly different from 0 $(ab = 0.3565, 95\% CI [0.197, 0.516], z = 4.382, p < .001)$

## Exercise

Test the following hypothesis:

> The effect of **Salary** on **Job Satisfaction** is explained by employee's **Age**

A mediation is obtained if:
- The $p$-value of the estimate $c$, **total effect**, is significant
- The $p$-value of the estimate $a$, **between the predictor and the mediator**, is significant
- The estimate $c'$, **direct effect**, has been reduced compared to the estimate $c$, **total effect**.
- The $p$-value of the **indirect effect** $ab$ is significant

```{r out.width='80%'}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

# Good Practices with Hypothesis Testing

- All hypotheses using the **same Outcome variable have to be tested in the same model** and not separately.

- Even if available, no need to use t-tests or ANOVA separate modules because the **Linear Regression can test all types of hypothesis**.

- **Do not use a correlation matrix to test your hypotheses**, they are excursively dedicated to evaluate correlations between predictors.

- A $p$-value never equals $0$, **round to $p < .001$ if shown as $0.000$**.
