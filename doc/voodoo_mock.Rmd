## Abstract

*The present paper is a replication of the paper entitled "Righting a wrong: Retaliation on a voodoo doll symbolizing an abusive supervisor restores justice" (Liang et al., 2018). This academic article was published the journal The Leadership Quartely and has been awarded with the prestigious IG Noble Price section Business Studies. By testing the hypotheses formulated by its authors on simulated data, the present paper will describe each steps of the academic writing.*

  'Abusive supervision is a problem for the mental well-being of employees. In case of behaviours charactering an abusive supervision such as such as public ridicule, yelling, scapegoating, or other forms of supervisor mistreatment, employees will have to deploy coping-mechanisms in order to preserve enough motivation to work in this negative environment. The predicate of the paper *Righting a wrong: Retaliation on a voodoo doll symbolizing an abusive supervisor restores justice* is that `a natural response for the subordinate is to directly retaliate against the abusive supervisor` (Liang et al., 2018, p. 443). This predicate is probably what made the paper published by Liang et al. (2018) an excellent candidate for the IG Nobel. However, this paper has an excellent structure and a very robust method. For these reason, it will be used as example of how to write an academic paper.',
